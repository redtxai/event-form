# PROJECT ROADMAP

## **Begining**

The project will start with the separation of the tasks. We'll have three main kind of tasks: **Micro Components**, **SMS tasks**, **Tests** and **Pages and Form**

### **Micro Components**

Consist in the investigation and creation of the unit components that will be added on the Pages/Forms that will allow the user interact with the applications. Examples: Event Name Input(Figma), Where switch(?)/checkbox(?) component(Figma), When component, URL input, buttons, etc.

### **SMS tasks**

SMS means **S**tate **M**anagement and **S**ervices. These tasks will be responsible to configured any State Management(if needed) and the services layer, such as the communication and configuration of the JSON server(if we have time). Also, these tasks will be responsible for the routing.

### **Tests** 

No need any description.

### **Pages and Form**

Basically, once we have a few components created, we are ready to start the creation of the pages and the Form that will be used on the application.
